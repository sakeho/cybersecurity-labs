# cybersecurity-projects
A collection of cybersecurity projects including port scanners, log analysers, file integrity checkers, and intrustion detection systems.

Each project is designed to deepen my understanding of real-world cybersecurity operations - reconnaissance, system hardening, and threat detection - while showcasing command-line and scripting proficiency in Bash, Python, and other technologies.
